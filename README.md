### What is Web Testing?

Web Testing, or website testing is checking your web application or website for potential bugs before its made live and is accessible to general public. Web Testing checks for functionality, usability, security, compatibility, performance of the web application or website.

During this stage issues such as that of web application security, the functioning of the site, its access to handicapped as well as regular users and its ability to handle traffic is checked

### Types of Testing

- Unit Tests
  - small individual test eg. test 1 function
  - need to write many unit tests
- Integration Tests
  - test with dependencies eg. test function that calls another function
  - need to write some integration tests
- End-to-End Tests
  - complete test eg. automate browser events
  - need to write very few end-to-end (e2e) tests

### How to test

- Test Runner
  - which runs the test & gives result (Mocha)
- Assertion Library
  - Sets testing conditions, matches & logics (Chai)
- Headless Browser
  - simulates the browser activity (Puppeteer)

##### Mocha + Chai = Jest
